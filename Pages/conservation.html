    <h1 class="title">Why ocean conservation matters</h1>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>Overfishing is depleting fish populations and disrupting marine ecosystems.</li>
        <li>Pollution — from plastics, oil, chemicals, and noise — is harming wildlife and entering the food chain.</li>
        <li>Climate change is warming the seas, bleaching coral reefs, and acidifying waters.</li>
        <li>Habitat destruction, especially from coastal development and deep-sea mining, is wiping out vital ecosystems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="title">What Ocean Conservation Looks Like</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <h4>Marine Protected Areas</h4>
        <p>
            Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are geographically defined areas within the ocean that are managed to conserve marine biodiversity, ecosystems, and resources for the long term.
            These areas restrict human activities to protect natural or cultural resources. MPAs are a globally recognized tool for managing and enhancing marine ecosystems, and they play a crucial role in protecting marine life and their habitats.
        </p>
        <h4>Sustainable Fishing Practices</h4>
        <p>
            Sustainable fishing practices ensure that fish populations remain abundant and the marine ecosystem is healthy, meeting the needs of both current and future generations.
            This is achieved by minimizing environmental impact, respecting habitats, and using fish stocks responsibly.
        </p>
        <h4>Coral Reef Restoration</h4>
        <p>
            Coral reef restoration involves rebuilding damaged or degraded reefs to restore their function and health.
            It's a crucial effort to address the impacts of climate change, pollution, and other threats to coral reefs.
            Restoration methods range from growing corals in nurseries to introducing beneficial species and addressing the underlying causes of reef decline.
        </p>
        <h4>Pollution Prevention</h4>
        <p>
            Pollution prevention involves reducing or eliminating pollution sources before they reach the ocean, as well as managing existing pollution.
            Key strategies include reducing plastic use, improving wastewater systems, and reducing chemical pollution. Other crucial steps include beach cleanups, monitoring and measuring progress, and supporting organizations working to protect the ocean
